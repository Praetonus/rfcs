# Summary

Ponybench provides a microbenchmarking facility that can be used to examine the performance of pony code. This gives users an opportunity to easily profile their programs, remove bottlenecks, and make them faster.

# Motivation

This package adds to the tooling around pony. Good tools support the language ecosystem and increase adoption.

# Detailed design

The API of this package is similar to that of ponytest for ease of use. The following is an example of a comlete program with 2 trivial benchmarks:

```pony

actor Main is BenchmarkList
  new create(env: Env) =>
    PonyBench(env, this)

  fun tag benchmarks(bench: PonyBench) =>
    bench(_BenchmarkAdd)
    bench(_BenchmarkSub)

class iso _BenchmarkAdd is Benchmark
  fun name(): String => "addition"

  fun apply(b: BenchmarkRunner) =>
    let n1: USize = 2
    let n2: USize = 2
    for i in Range[USize](0, b.n()) do
      b.discard(n1 + n2)
    end

class iso _BenchmarkSub is Benchmark
  fun name(): String => "subtraction"

  fun apply(b: BenchmarkRunner) =>
    let n1: USize = 4
    let n2: USize = 2
    for i in Range[USize](0, b.n()) do
      b.discard(n1 - n2)
    end

```

Each benchmark is run for a minimum of 1 second by default. If the second has not elapsed when the Benchmark function returns, the value of b.n() is increased in the sequence 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, â€¦ and the function is run again. A simple average (total time to run the benchmark function over b.n()) is used to calculate the execution time in nanoseconds.

Output:
```
addition      10000000	        28 ns/op
subtraction   10000000	        28 ns/op
```
This shows that each operation was executed 10,000,000 times and took an average of 28 ns/op (note that the accuracy is poor at low execution times until compiler optimization can be properly restricted).

# How We Teach This

Example use of the package should be included in the pony tutorial as well as the package docs, similar to ponytest.

# Drawbacks

None.

# Alternatives

None.

# Unresolved questions

- Should this be part of the current ponytest package?
- How may ponybench benchmark memory allocations?
