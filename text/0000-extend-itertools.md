# Summary

The itertools package of the standard library may be extended to provide useful classes and primitives for performing transformations on collections through the use of iterators. The package may eventually be extended to the equivalent of [Rust's Iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) or [Elixir's Enum](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Enum.html).

# Motivation

The goal of this RFC is to implement various data transformations such as map, filter, reduce, etc., now and with more to come, without re-implementing for every collection.

# Detailed design

1. Move the functionality of the primitives in itertools to a single wrapper class:
  
  ```pony
  class Iter[A] is Iterator[A]
    new create(iter: Iterator[A])
  ```
2. Add `enum` and `fold` methods to the class
  ```pony
  fun enum[B: (Real[B] val & Number) = USize]: Iter[A]^
    """
    An iterator which yields the current iteration count as well as the next value
    from the iterator.
    """
  
  fun fold[B](f: {(B, A!): B^ ?} box, acc: B): B^ ?
    """
    Apply a function to every element, producing an accumulated value.
    """
  ```

# How We Teach This

The current documentation in the itertools package will serve as the template for documenting classes added to the package.

# Drawbacks

This will break existing code.

# Alternatives

Add similar functionality to the Seq or Iterator interface directly

# Unresolved questions

None
